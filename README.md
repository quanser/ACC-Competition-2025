This Github Repo will host all the competition resources you will need to successfuly complete the competition. 

## ‚ùó Announcements üé§

- If you have any questions not answered in the discussions tab, please email studentcompetition@quanser.com. 
- If your university is using Python and/or ROS to architect their solution please review the `/software_setup/ACC software Instructions` for getting started with your system.  

## Competition Overview ü™ß
In this year‚Äôs competition, teams will try to maximize their profits as an autonomous taxi service. They will need to navigate through the city to selected pick-up and drop-off coordinates. During the trip, they will encounter different traffic scenarios that they will need to solve while adhering to the rules of the road. Depending on their performance during the trip, the teams will receive a rating for the executed ride that will influence the amount of money earned for the completion of the ride. Students will then receive additional ride requests and will try to maximize the amount of money they earn within a fixed timeframe. 
The three stages of the competition are outlined below:

Stage 1: Virtual Design and Submission 

Stage 2: Implementation of Self-Driving algorithm on the Physical QCar 2

Stage 3: On-site Competition  

All registrants will gain access to the Stage 1 virtual design phase, where a team‚Äôs skills will be tested in Quanser‚Äôs virtual environment. The top 6 teams, based on selected criteria, will be chosen to move on to the second and third stages of the competition.
In stage 2, the selected teams will receive a physical QCar 2 from Quanser and implement their Self-Driving algorithms on the  QCar2. They will then be required to bring their QCar 2 to the competition venue and compete live against other selected teams.
More details will be released about stages 2 and 3 in a subsequent handbook.

Please review the Software_Setup section for understanding how python and ROS are meant to be utilized. 

## Discussions üì£

Teams may discuss amongst each other in the [discussions](https://github.com/quanser/ACC-Competition-2025/discussions) tab of the Github. 

We would also like you to post any issues with supplied resources if you find them so that other teams may help or a Quanser representative can address them!
